This project does not seek to profit from the work of others

the base project of "Zerodytrash" was used for the connection to tiktok:
<a href="https://github.com/zerodytrash/TikTok-Live-Connector">

the instructions are the same, I just added the counter. If the project works for you, do not hesitate to follow "Zerodytrash" and follow me on my networks:

## Installation
To run the chat reader locally, follow these steps:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your system
2. Clone this repository or download and extract [this ZIP file](https://github.com/zerodytrash/TikTok-Chat-Reader/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
3. Open a console/terminal in the root directory of the project
4. Enter `npm i` to install all required dependencies 
5. Enter `node server.js` to start the application server

Now you should see the following message: `Server running! Please visit http://localhost:8091`<br>
Simply open http://localhost:8091/ in your browser. Thats it.

If you have problems with Node.js, you can also just open the `index.html` from the `public` folder.<br>
This will use the server backend of the [demo site](https://tiktok-chat-reader.zerody.one/), which is sufficient for testing purposes. If you want to offer it to others or make many connections at the same time, please consider using your own server.
